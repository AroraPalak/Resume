 During my initial days as a team member in a project at Quest Eduventures. I noticed that I was having hard time in getting beginning and completion dates of activities, status of underway activities and issues of any ongoing activities which I should know.

Therefore I recommended a Meeting on my Project where all my team members would meet for 5 to 15 minutes where the beginning
and completion of project activities were reported, the status of any activities that are underway was communicated to the rest of the project management team and Issues on any of the ongoing activities
 were identified.This actually helped us a lot in completing the project before the deadline

deescribe tecnologies
I am pretty excited about a few technologies:
-Gesture controlled computers as apple patented would make our life more easy as people spend more and more time on computers and the number would only increase in future.  This technology is pretty appealing to me
-Robot Scheduling Meetings : Well this would take artificial intelligence to the next level. 
-A Live translation tool: This is the most awesome one as there wont be any language barrier when a person would visit a country with different language. easy to reads signs and names everywhere with just a tool. So amazing!!
-Self Driving cars: Ohh my no Driver license required. Everyone could enjoy a ride in car with not much knowledge to gears and everything.
